# Configuring-Routing-Protocols-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

Description - Created a virtual network consisting of two companies having branches at different locations and connected
through 20 subnets over the internet.
Configured OSPF, EIGRP, RIP on cisco routers and performed route summarization along with route redistribution between OSPF and EIGRP networks to allow the flow of traffic between different branches and to the internet by propagating default route information.
